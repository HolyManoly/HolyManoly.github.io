description: This hackathon was definitely a blast! We had to use as much objects from the physical space as possible. So we had the golden box from the app as an actual clicker, we placed an actuak bowl of water as the fountain of youth, and used the LeapMotion controllers in order to bring in actual hands for the tethered Oculus Vive device.
