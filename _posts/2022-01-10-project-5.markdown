description: This hackathon was definitely a blast! We had to use as much objects from the physical space as possible. So we had the golden box from the app as an actual clicker, we placed a bowl of water as the fountain of youth, and used the LeapMotion controller in order to bring in physical hands for the tethered Oculus Vive device. Ended up winning second place!
