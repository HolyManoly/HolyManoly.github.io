description: Owned all systems for spatial interaction. From manipulating and world-locking panels and the 3D volume, to laying them out and manipulating them through the 2D monitor. I added automatic spatial tool activation, built the remote devices system for external cameras and lastly, prototyped a system for multiple 3D views of the scene.
