description: Working as an Experiences developer at this company has been nothing short of amazing. Started as VR only, but now radically cross-platform, we're constantly faced with new challenges when it comes to designing for usability and engagement. I've worked on various user-facing features, enjoying a tight iteration loop with designers across the company.
