description: You're playing Robbie, a boy that came home only to find his computer attacked by a malicious virus. If you want to take back control, you'll have to play his game. I started playing around with this idea in 2018, got the initial prototype built up and realized that the teleportation controls don't feel as good as I'd imagined them to. Next steps would be to implement a movement system that would go on rails, which would represent circuits on a motherboard, backpacking memory addresses to pick which way to go.
