description: I worked at Digital Mind, LLC, Belgrade for about 10 months. It was a blast, and I really fell in love with experimentation, rapid prototyping and playing around with a bunch of cool toys. Worked on a range of engaging experiences for different clients, aimed at engaging customers commercially. All of the materials in the showcase reel is taken from the company website. I implemented some of the experiences in it myself, helped maintain/expand some of them, and also worked on a bunch more. All in all, fun times :)
