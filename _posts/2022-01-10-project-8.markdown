description: Working at Microsoft was loads of fun! I got to prototype out a bunch of cool ideas, some of them unfortunately never making it into production. Among the ones that did, I implemented a system for importing and manipulating 3D gltf models through OneDrive, integrated Azure Remote Rendering, and helped build the initial version of colocated experiences through Azure Spatial Anchors. I also contributed to the design of the app, reducing clickthrough for some user flows and participated in all of user research that came by for other Hololens experiences. All of the showcase material in the portfolio is taken from the company website and owned by Microsoft.
