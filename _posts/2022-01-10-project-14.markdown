description: This is a project I created for the needs of LAUDA, Unity workshop I founded in order to teach Unity to highschool students. The project is a gallery of games that students create, and can be accessed on our website https://lauda-edu.org/ as a WebGL build. I also created learning materials for the course, which are available on Github.
