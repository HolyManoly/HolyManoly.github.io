description: A fun little multiplayer prototype I created to test out a game idea. Players move on their own grids in order to reach a goal location, by pulling themselves towards the adjacent grid location. After creating a couple of different prototypes and movement schemas, I landed on this one, since it proved to be most predictable and caused the most amount of nausea for me :D. Players also have the option to block the other players grid spot by shooting it, making it unusable for some amount of time. Had a bunch of fun making it!
