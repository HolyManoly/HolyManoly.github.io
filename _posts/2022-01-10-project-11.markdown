description: Having to redesign a physical space can be difficult, especially if you're not able to be physically present. That's the situation I found myself in before making this project. My old house was getting a redesign, and I wanted to get a sense of the new space before we hire contractors to do it. I asked my dad to send me the blueprint, and I made this prototype so we can share screen and walk through it together before deciding on the final design.
