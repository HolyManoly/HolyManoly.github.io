description: A VR Detective game, where you play one of two detectives trying to figure out what's going on in your town. I started making this game about a year ago, and have been adding features to it ever since. Goal is to have it as a playground for prototyping out different VR mechanics, like using a camera to gather evidence, using your cop badge to go through locked gates etc.
