description: AnatomyX is a XR app made to teach medical students about human anatomy. It supports multiplayer, colocated experiences using physical anchors, as well as custom anatomy lessons you can create in a web backend. I worked on porting the whole app from its Hololens1 version to use Oculus Quest, as well as updating MRTK from 2 to 3. Improved body part interactions and added magnetism for much better look and feel.
