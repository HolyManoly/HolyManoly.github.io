description: This is a fun little game I made as a part of Petnica Machine Learning Summer Institute 2015. We trained a deep recurrent model to recognize human faces and if folks are puffing their cheecks or not. The "puff" signal was used in a 2D side-scroller similar to Flappy Bird, in order to control the players character.
