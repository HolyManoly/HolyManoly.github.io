description: This is a project I created for teaching a Unity workshop at a university. It starts of as a boring PowerPoint deck, and after a while, the deck falls down and students realize it's an FPS game. It has a building with an elevator, every floor representing a concept of Unity development. Loads of fun making this, the students enjoyed it as well. :)
